Cloud To Mordor
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'mordor', and other amusing cloud-related substitutions.

This is a very basic hack of cloud-to-butt plus. I don't actually know javascript; I'm just faking it enough to modify the original to do what I want it to do.
